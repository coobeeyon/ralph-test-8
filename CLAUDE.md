# Project Instructions

Read `SPEC.md` first. It defines what to build.

## Workflow

1. Check `lb list` for existing tasks
2. If tasks exist, pick one and implement it
3. If no tasks exist, read SPEC.md, create an epic with tasks, then start implementing
4. Follow `AGENTS.md` for the Landing the Plane protocol — always push before finishing

## Conventions

- Use litebrite (`lb`) for all task tracking
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Research anything you're unsure about before implementing
- The agent can modify `scripts/runner/Dockerfile` to add project-specific dependencies (Python, Rust, etc.)
